Python motu client

# Motivations

This package is a fork of [http://sourceforge.net/projects/cls-motu/files/client/motu-client-python/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cls-motu/files/client/motu-client-python/). It aims to re-package the original code in a way compatible with pypi.

# Installation

```bash
$ pip install https://github.com/quiet-oceans/motuclient-setuptools/archive/motu-client-1.4.00.tar.gz
```
